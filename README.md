# Update 23rd August

The Crota's End, King's Fall and Wrath of the Machine pages will unfortunately not be complete for the dissertation's hand-in, so it will only be the Vault of Glass content that will be included. I will be updating this in time.

# IMPORTANT

If you're reading this, you've made it to the Ghost Raider App page! Perfect! Now, let's get back onto the main, meaty topic.

Go back to the Ghost-Raider Directory page and download the ZIP File, found on the green button on the right-hand side. (Clone or Download)

Once this is done, extract the contents of your ZIP File onto any Drive Folder of your choosing.

# Hi Guardians of r/DestinyTheGame,

The name’s Angus McCallum, but most people prefer to call me by my Guardian’s alias, King Sangos. I’m a post-graduate University Student aiming to get his Master’s Degree ((MsC) Mobile Media Applications), as well as an adoring fan of Destiny. I’m currently in the wraps of completing my final Dissertation Report Unit, which I managed to make Destiny-related, thanks to an older version of my App that I completed months ago.

But this is where I need help from you guys/girls. For this dissertation, one of the key stages of the Report is the testing phase, and I wanted to make sure I nailed this stage as early and smoothly as I could. Now with that earlier context out of the way, here’s what the App is and what purpose it serves.

Ghost Raider is a Mobile E-Learning App that aims to teach newer players about all of Destiny 1’s four raids and how to successfully complete them. This is done using visual imagery, dormant accessibility (the intention for the App was to allow people to access it ANYWHERE, not just their homes) and honest writing. 

I’ve developed Ghost Raider because through my experiences playing many Raids on Destiny 1 and watching several online media outlets (YouTube, Xbox DVR, Twitch.Tv, etc), I’ve noticed that many players still struggled with grasping with Raids and their mechanics, sometimes leaving key details out of explanations (What Taken Abilities Warpriest gets depending on which Monolith disappears, the Grasp of Crota Debuff if you try to cheese Bridge, etc, etc). 

Now I understand that the truly best way to understand the mechanics is to go through Trial ‘n’ Error in the fight itself. But in some cases where I’ve been in a group with a freshboi, he/she’s been abused at for not understanding a specific part of an encounter and in extreme cases, removed from a FireTeam (These sadly came from groups where “Newbies Welcome” or “Carry” are being advertised on the LFG posts). Additionally, a Mobile E-Learning App like Ghost Raider hasn’t really done before, so I thought it’d a wonderful thing to have for Destiny users that avidly use Mobile Devices. (the best one I can remember is Destiny Raid Buddy, which was abandoned shortly after King’s Fall’s release).

Finally, Destiny 2 is just around the corner and all Destiny-1 related content will quickly-then-gradually become irrelevant to Destiny fans as the weeks pass. However, I have no plans to publicly release this App to online App stores, and exclusively developed this App for University-purposes. Who knows though, Gary’s fate may prove otherwise should this App’s framework be greatly desired.
For now, though, I’m setting my sights on Destiny 1 and the Ghost Raider App. So why do I need your help? Because I want your feedback on both the look and concept of the App. I need to App to be tested and given feedback so that I can critically reflect on it in my dissertation. Don’t worry, I have absolutely no plans on leaking any personal information. All feedback and criticism directed towards the App will go straight into the Dissertation.

Now to make sure I’m doing this correctly, safely and honestly with you guys, I’ve contacted the r/DestinyTheGame team and made sure to get this post approved by them beforehand. The last thing I want to do is interrupt you all (Same reason why I’m releasing this post tonight, to give you PvP Gods that last Lighthouse Visit before the World without Light.)
When you download the file, have a good look around and see what you think. Currently, this is the first version of the App and only includes the Homepage, the Settings Page and the HUB pages. Over the next week or two, my plan is to release new versions of the App to be tested again. If you have any questions or comments you’d like to make about the App, please leave me a Direct Message on my Discord Account, or leave a response underneath the post as well.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I wish you a good day/night/afternoon/light. : D
