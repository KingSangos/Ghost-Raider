	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
	<h3>Lore</h3>
	<h4>Deep within the jungles of Venus lies a sanctuary, filled with mystery, wonder and great evil. A vault of unimaginable power, where the Vex, a race of trans-temporal cybernetic machines rule as masters of time and space. To understand the Vault of Glass, you must understand the Vex and the Pattern.
</br>
</br>
To the Vex, there exists only the Pattern. An absolute truth of perfection that has only one form; one future. Yet there are also anomalous factors in the equation. Glitches in the system that would unravel everything the Vex hold sacred. Because of this, the Vex seek to cut anything away that doesn't fall in line with the Pattern. Despite their incredible numbers and immeasurable levels of intelligence however, the Vex are still bound by the dimensional laws that bind our universe together. This is an arbitrary principle that the Vex aim to absolve.
</br>
</br>
In our reality, the Vex have their limits. But in the Vault of Glass, they rule reality in its absolute form. In the Vault, they are the masters of existence itself. Seeking to understand this place, many have led expeditions inside the Vault of Glass, such as Kabr the Legionless, Pahanin and Praedyth. But any who entered the heart of the Vault eventually became lost to time, even if their strength in the Light was unmatched.
</br>
</br>
Now, the Vanguard has sent you and five other Guardians into the Vault of Glass to stop whatever it is the Vex are planning. While the Vex may only be able to alter reality inside the Vault, who's to say they won't find a way to replicate their discoveries into our universe?

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Released on September 16th 2014, the Vault of Glass is the first of the four Raids in Destiny to have been released. The Raid can only be unlocked after completing the Main Storyline of the Destiny 1.
</br>
</br>
Here are the level requirements for each version of the Raid:
</br>
<h3>NORMAL Mode: Level 26
HARD Mode: Level 30
390LL Mode:Level 40 
</br>(Light Level 390)
</h3>

</br>
<img src="gjallarhorn.jpg" alt="Gjallarhorn">
<h3 style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFF700;">Exotic of the Raid</h3>
<p>The most powerful Exotic Weapon to use in the Vault of Glass is arguably the Gjallarhorn. In addition to the intrinsic perk, Wolfpack Rounds, the Gjallarhorn can deal a massive amount of damage to a target, has great crowd control possibilities and tracking rounds, leading to more accurate shots when zoomed in.
</br>
</br>
Many of the Vault of Glass' unique enemies and The Templar have large health-pools and small critical spots. The Gjallarhorn can deal large burst damage with each rocket and doesn't require players hitting these spots to achieve this.
</br>
</br>
With the release of Destiny's fourth expansion, Rise of Iron, the Gjallarhorn is now easily obtainable to all players and you are not required to complete a Raid to get it.

<h3>Unique Raid Relic:</h3>
<h2>The Aegis</h2>
<p>Found within several encounters of the Vault of Glass is 'The Aegis'. It is a Shield-based Weapon that can counteract many mechanics found in the Encounters of the Vault of Glass. Here are the controls to using this weapon:</p>
<p><strong>Melee Attack (On Land)</strong>: The Player executes a Melee-Bash attack that can be used in combination three more times. (Bash-Bash-Bash).
</br>
</br>
<strong>Melee Attack (In Mid-Air)</strong>: The Player executes an aerial dash-attack, which also allows them to hover for a short bit.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Primary Fire (On Land)</strong>: The Player executes a powerful Shield-Bash that can instantly kill weaker enemies.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Primary Fire (In Mid-Air)</strong>: The Player executes an Area-of-Effect Shockwave that can instantly kill weaker enemies.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Grenade</strong>: The Player creates an AOE barrier around them that protects them and anyone inside the barrier from any damage. Additionally, the barrier also creates a Cleanse effect, removing important de-buffs in some of the Encounters. The Cleanse effect cannot be used while sprinting and/or in mid-air.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Super</strong>: Shoots a powerful Orb of Light that targets ahead of the user in a straight line, tracking any enemies nearby.
</p>
</br>

<img src="normalVex.jpg" alt="Normal Vex Enemies">
<h3>Enemies:</h3>
<p>Goblins are used as cannon-fodder in the Vault of Glass Raid, serving as an excellent way for players to generate Orbs of Light and Super Energy. Be wary, however, as Goblins can still prove to be formidable force, as their large numbers can easily overwhelm a player if left unchecked.
</p>
<p>Hobgoblins are one of the more dangerous enemies you'll find the Vault of Glass. Their Solar Line Rifle attacks will very often three-shot you if you're out in the open. Unlike various Patrol and Story Mission locations, Vex Hobgoblins have very specific spawn placements in the Vault of Glass. 
</p>
<p>Minotaurs are the bulkiest and most dangerous of the regular enemies you will face in the Vault of Glass. Their large health and powerful Void Bolt attacks make them very dangerous foe in close-proximity.
</p>
<p>Harpies, like Goblins, are used a cannon-fodder in some instances of the Raid, yet still can prove to be very dangerous to players in large groups. Additionally, Harpies can move extremely fast and have a rapid solar attack that can easily take down a player's shields, leaving other enemies to finish the job.</p>
</p>
<p>In addition to these default enemy types, the Vault of Glass also contains some unique enemy variations, each possessing their own mechanics and troubles to players.</p>
<img src="praetorian.jpg" alt="Praetorian">
<h3>Praetorian</h3>
<p>Praetorians are a unique, Major-Class variation of the Minotaur enemy found in various parts of the Vault of Glass Raid. Save for their unique coloration and aggressive nature (they often come into close-proximity to players to deal heavy damage), they are no different than a regular Major-Class Minotaur. Their unique mechanic in the Raid, however, is the ability to deactivate Sync Plates when standing inside one.</p>
</br>
<img src="supplicant.jpg" alt="Supplicant">
<h3>Supplicant</h3>
<p>Supplicants are a unique variation of the Harpy enemies. In addition to possessing a regular Harpy's attack patterns, Supplicants can detonate themselves in close-proximity. If a player is right next to them and hit by the explosion, they will instantly be killed (unless they have defensive buffs applied and/or are blocking with a Sword).</p>
</br>
<img src="fanatic.jpg" alt="Fanatic">
<h3>Fanatic</h3>
<p>Fanatics are an extremely dangerous, Major-Class variation of the Goblin enemy. Fanatics behave like Vex Goblins without their heads and often charge towards the player. Much like a Supplicant, if a Fanatic comes into close-proximity of a player, they will explode, dealing a large amount of damage. Additionally, when a Fanatic dies, it will leave a small pool of corrupted, green energy known as a Pool of Negation. If a player touches this pool, they will be affected with the debuff, Marked for Negation.</p>
</br>
<img src="yellowOracle.jpg" alt="Yellow Oracle">
<h3>Oracle (Yellow)</h3>
<p>Yellow Oracles are stationery enemies found in the Vault of Glass that are only found in two encounters on Normal Mode and one on Hard Mode. Oracles have pre-determined spawns and cannot attack players. However, if left unchecked, Yellow Oracles will apply the debuff, Marked for Negation to the player.</p>
</br>
<img src="redOracle.jpg" alt="Red Oracle">
<h3>Oracle (Red)</h3>
<p>Red Oracles, much like Yellow Oracles, are stationery enemies found in the Vault of Glass that are found in one encounter on Normal Mode and two on Hard Mode. They behave exactly like Yellow Oracles, except when a Red Oracle activates, it will mark the player with the Prophecy of Doom debuff, draining your Super energy and instantly killing you shortly afterwards.</p>
</br>
<img src="gatekeeper.jpg" alt="Gatekeeper">
<h3>Gatekeeper</h3>
<p>Gatekeepers are a unique, Major-Class enemy variation of the Vex Hydra. Aside from the name and special appearance, they behave no differently than a regular Major-Class Hydra.</p>
</br>
<img src="precursorsAndDescendants.jpg" alt="Precursors & Descendants">
<h3>Precursors & Descendants</h3>
<p>Precursors and Descendants are unique, Major-Class enemy variations of the Vex Goblins, Hobgoblins and Minotaurs. Aside from the names and special appearances, they behave no differently than their regular counterparts.</p>
</br>
<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
</br>
<img src="vogIntro3.jpg" alt="Vog Introduction Image 3">
<h3>Final Notes:</h3>
<p>The Vault of Glass Raid is filled with powerful enemies that possess large health-pools and strong attacks. Additionally, the locations you will be fighting in often include multiple narrow passageways, where enemy ambushes are very likely to occur. Because of this, the most effective way to complete the Vault of Glass' encounters is to play defensively and conservatively. Ensure your weapons and armour allow you to deal high-burst damage in close-proximity, and always keep a look out on your surroundings. By keeping tabs on the enemy spawns during an encounter, you won't be overwhelmed as the fight continues.
</br>
</br>
Close-Range weapons such as Shotguns, Snipers and Swords work wonders on many of enemies in the Vault of Glass, and will save you a lot of hassle during the Raid's more challenging encounters.

	<h3>Lore</h3>
	<h4>Within the Waking Ruins of the Ishtar Sink, the entrance to Vault of Glass lays dormant. It is among the most sacred of locations for the Hezen Corrective and the Vex are determined to keep any unwanted anomalies in their pattern out. However, there exists a means to forcefully open the Vault. By using the Vex's own technology against them, the Guardians can construct a key that'll open the way to the heart of the Vault.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Serving as the first encounter of the Vault of Glass Raid, players are tasked with the goal of opening the door to the Vault of Glass and facing the darkness of the Vex within. To do this, they will need activate and protect three Sync Plates found around the Waking Ruins. When all three are active, a giant Vex Spire in the centre will begin to construct. During this time, a series of Vex enemies will spawn near each Sync plate and attempt to deactivate the Plates and disrupt the construction process.
</br>
</br>
Once the Spire has been fully built, all enemies on the map will disappear and the encounter will be complete.
</br>
</br>
Something to note is that the Waking Ruins is NOT a Darkness Zone, so respawning restrictions are not in effct here. Additionally, because the Waking Ruins is also a public playspace, Fireteams may also run into other players partaking in other activities. Furthermore, these random players may even help your Fireteam construct the Spire.

<img src="razelighter.jpg" alt="razelighter">
<h3 style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFF700;">Exotic of the Encounter</h3>
<p>When it comes to dealing close-range, single-target damage, nothing compares to the Exotic Sword: The Raze-Lighter. Capable of killing a Major-Class in two fell strikes, the Raze-Lighter is perfect for tackling the Praetorians that attempt to deactivate the Sync plates.
</br>
</br>
Additionally, the Raze-Lighter is also very good at crowd-controlling other Vex enemies, such as Goblins and Hobgoblins. It can also be somewhat effective against Harpies, but the Raze-Lighter can have trouble hitting airborne enemies.

<h3>Encounter Map</h3>

</br>
<img src="vogCTS3.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>When all six players have formed a Fireteam, selected the Vault of Glass Raid on the Director Menu and begun the mission, they will spawn near the cliff-face of the Waking Ruins, directly opposite to the entrance of the Vault of Glass.
</br>
</br>
As soon as players have spawned in, they must immediately make their way to the three Sync plates dotted around the Vault of Glass entrance. This is because the enemies guarding the entrance to the Vault of Glass will immediately start spawning in and begin defending their respective Sync Plates. Here are the three Sync Plates that players will need to defend.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogCTS4.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<p style="font-style: italic;">The Sync Plates</p>
<p>The most effective way to defend these Plates is to split your Raid team into three pairs of two and assign them to a corresponding plate (e.g. 2 Left, 2 Middle and 2 Right). Have one person in each pair stand inside or near the Sync Plate, whilst having the other stay on high ground to spot, kill and control any enemies their partners on the Plate can't see and/or attack.
</br>
</br>
Once a player stands on a Sync Plate, it will begin activating, as seen below:
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogCTS5.jpg" alt="Sync Plate Active">
</br>
<p>One thing to note is that the white, holographic barrier surrounding the plate is only visual confirmation that signifies it has begun activating. This holographic barrier will continue to grow in height, until it reaches a certain point. Once this happens, the Sync Plate will become fully active and will no longer require a player to be standing inside it.
</br>
</br>
For the Spire to begin its construction, all three Sync Plates must be fully activated and remain like this until the Spire has finished building itself. If any of the three Sync Plates become deactivated, the Spire will stop forming and slowly begin to deconstruct itself. If this happens, simply have one person stand back on the Plate once it's clear of enemies and wait for it to become fully activated again.
</br>
</br>
During the encounter, a variety of enemies will spawn around four key locations of the Waking Ruins map, via Doorways and Vex Cloud Spawns.
</p>
<img src="vogCTS6.jpg" alt="Vex Spawns">
<p style="font-style: italic;">Vex Spawn Areas</p>
<p>While these enemies mainly consist of Goblins, Hobgoblins and Harpies, there are Praetorians that will occasionally spawn in to try and put to a stop to you. Should a Praetorian make it past your defences and enter a Sync, they will deactivate it and begin deconstructing the Spire.
</br>
</br>
To stop this, you simply need to kill the Praetorian on the Sync Plate, then reactivate the Plate after it has been defeated.
</p>
<img src="vogCTS7.jpg" alt="Vault Entrance">
<p>After constructing the Spire and defending the Sync Plates for a few minutes, a message will appear stating that 'The Spire has been activated!' and will finish its construction. After which, all enemies in the Waking Ruins will de-spawn and the entrance to the Vault of Glass will open, effectively completing the Encounter.
</p>
</br>
	<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
	<h3>Rewards</h3>
	<p>Absolutely none! :D</p>
	</br>
		<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>The enemies in the Waking Ruins are low-levelled, so defeating enemies like Vex Goblins and Harpies is no big-deal. Your challenge here will come from dealing with the Praetorians, which have more health than the other enemies and tend to charge towards a Sync Plate. But if you have a weapon capable of dealing strong burst damage, you should be fine.
</br>
</br>
While this Encounter is the first of the Raid, it is important to take notes on how the Sync Plates and Praetorians work, as you will be working with these mechanics later in the Raid.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>The Trial of Kabr is a series of cavernous tunnels that lead deeper into the Vault of Glass. This area serves as a reprieve for players after completing their first encounter, as well as a chance for them to familiarize themselves with their surroundings. The majority of the Raid will take place inside these dark chasms, so slowly introducing players to this new environment is imperative.

</br>
The Trial of Kabr is NOT a Darkness Zone, so respawn restrictions are not put in place.

<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>
To successfully navigate the Trials' dark passageways, make sure to keep a good eye on your surroundings and check for any dark corners in the rocks around you. There is only one path to take here, but it bends and swerves around every corner. Just continue making your way, until you make it to this room pictured above.
</br>
</br>
This is where you will find the very first Raid Chest. Once opened, this Chest remain accessible to players for a maximum of ten minutes. After that, the chest will despawn and you will lose your chance at obtaining the rewards if you didn't open it in that time.

After unlocking the chest, there are two pathways to take. The first is the regular path, located in a corridor just next to where the first chest spawns. Following this pathway will eventually take you to the main entrance of the Templar's Well. The second path will lead you to a secret corridor hidden just underneath the room you are currently in and can be seen here.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogTOK3.jpg" alt="Hidden Chest Route">
<p>After making your way through this hidden entrance, you will have a series of semi-difficult jumps you will have to make to progress forward. The path will lead you downwards, so keep heading that way until you see a notification telling you that you have just entered the Templar's Well. This will signify that you are on the right path, so continue making your through the foliage-covered Vex structures until you reach the second Raid chest.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogTOK4.jpg" alt="Hidden Chest">
<p>The chest here will yield the same rewards as the one before, with the same chance of obtaining an Exotic.
</br>
</br>
After opening the chest, continue through the various jumping obstacles forward, until you reach an opening in one of the walls. Jump over the chasm and continue walking through this hidden entrance. It will eventually lead you to a side passage near the Templar's Well.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>The Trial of Kabr serves as a form of respite for players as well as a method of familiarizing the players to their surroundings inside the Vault of Glass. The rest of the Raid will be inside this dark cavern, so getting the players used to this pristine environment is essential. Additionally, the inclusion of loot as early as this is a nice incentive to continue the Raid.
</br>
</br>
If you find yourself unable to spot certain passageways because of the dark lighting, it is recommended that you increase the brightness of your screen for the remainder of the Vault of Glass Raid.

You are merely a glitch that can be fixed.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>As the second Encounter of the Vault of Glass Raid, Defend the Confluxes is the first real challenge that players will have to face. To complete it, the Fireteam will have to defend a series of Vex Confluxes that spawn around the Templar's Well and prevent any enemies from sacrificing themselves inside.
</br>
</br>
After a Conflux has successfully been defended, it will disappear and the Templar will summon a legion of Vex enemies to slaughter you. After surviving these hordes of enemies, more Confluxes will spawn and players will have repeat the process. After three Conflux rotations have passed and the final wave of enemies disappear, the Encounter will be complete.
</br>
</br>
Defend the Confluxes is the first Darkness Zone of the Raid, so Respawn Restrictions are put in place. They are as follows:
</p>

<h4>Normal Mode: 30-Second Respawn Time
</br>(Requires another Player to Revive)
</br>
</br>
Hard Mode: No Revive
</br>
</br>
390LL Mode: No Revive

<p>During this encounter, there will be lots of enemies spawning in large packs, as well as larger enemies such as the Minotaurs and Fanatics that need to be killed as quickly as possible. The Gjallarhorn can do both with ease. In addition to having the intrinsic perk, Wolfpack Rounds, the Gjallarhorn can also deal a massive amount of damage to a single target, has a good Blast Radius to clear areas and tracking shots when zoomed in, leading to more accurate shots.

<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>Upon landing in the Templar's Well, the Encounter will begin and the Templar will immediately spawn, summoning the first Conflux. This will spawn at the back of the room in the middle. 
</br>
</br>
Unlike the Vex Confluxes found in Venus Patrol Missions, you can only allow a maximum of three Vex enemies to sacrifice themselves to a single Conflux. Any more than this and the Conflux will activate, giving you and Fireteam the Expunged debuff, which will quickly drain your Super Energy and kill your entire team. The only way to avert this fate is to stop the Vex from reaching these Confluxes at all
</br>
</br>
After the first Conflux spawns, several Vex enemies will begin appearing around various parts of the room, making their way towards it. To prevent them from sacrificing themselves, the Fireteam will need to split up into three teams of two and occupy three spaces on the map, much like how the team was arranged for the 'Constructing the Spire' Encounter (This time, 2 on the Left, 2 on the Right and 2 in the Back Middle).
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogDTF6.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<p>
One mechanic that players will need to be aware of is that throughout the Encounter, the Templar will periodically disappear and reappear in the fight to attack any players in its line of sight. The Templar can deal a massive amount of damage to a player if they've left themselves unguarded, so it's important to stay out of its line of sight and communicate with the team when it's spawned in and out of the fight.
</br>
</br>
As time passes and you continue defending the Conflux, Vex Fanatics will begin to spawn in an attempt to sacrifice themselves to the Conflux. Fanatics act exactly like a Headless Goblins, but will charge towards the plate with no restraint. If you kill a Fanatic or it comes into close contact and explodes, it will leave a pool of corrupted green energy known as a Negation Zone on the area where it died. Contacting this substance will give you the Marked for Negation Debuff, which can stack up to four times. On its own, contracting the Debuff won't do anything, save for a disgusting green overlay covering your screen when you have it. However, this Debuff will need to be removed as soon as possible, because of the mechanic known as the Ritual of Negation.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogDTF7.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<p>When cast, the Templar will channel an ability that instantly kills anyone with the Marked for Negation Debuff upon it's complete. To counteract this, players will need to walk into a Pool of Light directly underneath the Templar that can remove all stacks of the Debuff on contact. However, there is a limit to how many stacks the Pool of Light can remove and its continued usage will eventually lead to the Pool disappearing entirely. Thankfully, the Pool of Light will replenish itself for every Ritual of Negation cast by the Templar.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogDTF8.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
</br>
<p>After successfully defending the Conflux for a few minutes, it and all the enemies on the map will disappear. The Templar will then reappear at the centre and begin to summon its legions. This mechanic involves a massive number of Vex enemies spawning beneath and around the Templar, with the sole intention of killing your entire team. When this happens, all players of the fireteam should return to defend the back-middle platform. By doing this, the team can bottle-neck the enemies, taking care of them with ease. Just be careful not to stay near these chokepoints and there are several Fanatics among the hordes of enemies. Crowd-controlling Supers like Void Tethers and Hammer of Sols work excellently for this phase.
</br>
</br>
Additionally, as more enemies spawn in, Major-Class Harpies and Supplicants will begin spawning in and make their way towards the player. These enemies will need to be taken down quickly as Supplicants can instantly kill a nearby player with their explosions and Harpies can deal a large burst of damage to anyone in its line of sight. Finally, the Templar will reappear again near the end of the phase to deal more even more damage, so repeat what you did before and stay out of its line of sight.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogDTF5.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<p>
After some time, the enemies will stop spawning and the Templar will begin casting the Ritual of Negation once again. If you are Marked at this point, make your way towards the Pool of Light to cleanse yourself. After the Ritual is complete, the Conflux Defence Phase of the fight will begin again, only this time, there will be TWO Confluxes to defend.
</br>
</br>
These Confluxes will be located on both the Left and Right sides of the map, but it is still important for the team to keep the position roles that they had before. This is because Minotaurs will begin spawning in the middle, so there will need to be people killing them before they harm anyone on the Left and Right sides. Furthermore, Harpies will begin spawning on the Left and Right sides, so it's extremely important that players keep a keen eye on their surroundings.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogDTF9.jpg" alt="Constructing the Spire Map">
<p>
The same phases as before will continue, which will eventually lead to the third and final phase, where players will have to defend THREE Confluxes. The positioning of the players remains the same, only this time they will have to pay extra attention to their surroundings.
</br>
</br>
Finally, once the Confluxes have been successfully defended and the Templar's Legions have been defeated, no more Confluxes will spawn the Encounter will be complete.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>The key to successfully completing this Encounter is to always keep an eye on your surroundings. Many of the tougher enemies that spawn, like the Minotaurs, Fanatics and Supplicants can often sneak up behind you if you aren't looking. When this happens, it is very likely that you will die, or waste a Super that could've used more conservatively.
</br>
</br>
Furthermore, play defensively on this part. Your primary objective isn't about how much damage you can deal. It's about how long and efficiently you can protect a series of objectives. If there's an enemy that's snuck by, be sure to point it out to other members of your team. A slight overlap in communication is better than having to accommodate for a team member who isn't alive.

	<h4>After witnessing the Hezen Protective failing to erase you from its reality, The Templar has concluded you and your Fireteam to be a significant threat to the Vex Collective Mind.

<img src="vogDTF2.jpg" alt="VOG DTC Image 1">
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>As the third Encounter, Destroy the Oracles takes place shortly after completing the Defend the Confluxes encounter. In this encounter, a unique set of enemies called Oracles will spawn throughout the Templar's Well map in various locations. These Oracles must be destroyed before the Templar begins casting the Ritual of Negation.
</br>
</br>
There are four waves of Oracles that spawn and within each phase, all Oracles must be destroyed before the Ritual of Negation is cast. If even one Oracle is unsuccessfully destroyed, it will disappear and all players will be affected with the Marked for Negated Debuff. Additionally, if an Oracle disappears, the Wave will reset and players will have to try again until they succeed.
</br>
</br>
Once the Fireteam has destroyed the fourth and final wave of Oracles, the Templar will cast its final Ritual of Negation and the encounter will be complete.
</br>
</br>
Destroy the Oracles is still a Darkness Zone in the Raid, so Respawn Restrictions are put in place. They are as follows:
</p>
<h4>Normal Mode: 30-Second Respawn Time

<p>Oracles are stationary targets, but they have small hit-boxes. Furthermore, they hold great resistance against weapons like Sniper Rifles and Rocket Launchers. Thankfully, the Dark-Drinker can deal a large amount of radial damage with its Special Attack and will hit an Oracle multiple times. Additionally, the Dark-Drinker deals Void damage, making it an absolute beast when dealing with the Void-Shield Minotaurs that spawn during this Encounter.

<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>After successfully completing the Defend the Confluxes Encounter, the Templar will begin to summon the Oracles. After a few seconds, a series of Oracles will begin to periodically spawn and disappear in the room. After this short sequence ends, the first Oracle will spawn again and the Encounter will begin.
</br>
</br>
When an Oracle spawns in the Templar's Well, it will make a distinct chime. This jingle can be heard from great distances and varies in tone, depending on where an Oracle spawns. Beneath is a list of the places where an Oracle can spawn.
</br>
</br>
<h4>

</br>
Low Left â€“ L2
</br>
Back Left â€“ L3
</br>
Right Stairs â€“ R1
</br>
Far Right â€“ R2
</br>
Back Right â€“ R3
</h4>
<p>Shortly after the final Oracle in a wave has spawned, the Templar will reappear and begin casting the Ritual of Negation. If your Fireteam successfully destroyed all the Oracles in the wave, you will not have to worry about this mechanic. However, if an Oracle is left alive, it will disappear after some time and apply the Marked for Negation Debuff on all players. Furthermore, the current wave will reset and the Fireteam will have to repeat the wave.
</br>
</br>
Like the way it was dealt before in the Defend the Confluxes Encounter, the Pool of Light remains in the centre of the room and walking into it will cleanse you and remove the Marked for Negation Debuff. It still has a limited use, so failing an Oracle wave too many times will eventually lead to the Pool of Light running out and wiping your team.
</br>
</br>
However, the Templar and the Hezen Protective will do everything in their power to stop you, so in addition to destroying the Oracles, you will also have to deal with the Templar and enemies that spawn in the Templar's Well. First of all, the Templar will continue to attack you, much like it did in the Defend the Confluxes Encounter, so it is imperative that you try to stay out of its line of sight. Second, a series of Goblins and Minotaurs will spawn in various parts of the room and attempt to kill anyone trying to destroy the Oracles.
</p>
<img src="vogDTO4.jpg" alt="Hobgoblins">
<p>
But the most important enemy that players must be aware of and deal with are the Hobgoblins. Unlike the Hobgoblins in the Defend the Confluxes encounter, these Hobgoblins will spawn on various platforms outside the map itself. Their purpose is to spot anyone destroying Oracles and snipe them from a distance. Failure to deal with these Hobgoblins will result in an increase of trouble for players, as it's hard to kill Oracles and Minotaurs when you keep getting sniped.
</br>
</br>
In this Encounter, players will ultimately have to deal with and manage four waves of Oracles, each with their own predetermined spawn locations. These are as followed:
<h4>
Wave 1: Mid, R2, R1, L2, L1, L3, R1, R2, R3
</br>
Wave 2: L1, R3, R1, L3, Mid, L2, R2
</br>
Wave 3: R1, L1, R2, L2, Mid, L3, R3
</br>
Wave 4: R3, L2, R2, L3, R1, L1, Mid, R3, L2
</h4>
<p>
Shortly after the final Oracle in a wave has spawned, the Templar will reappear and begin casting the Ritual of Negation. If your Fireteam successfully destroyed all the Oracles in the wave, you will not have to worry about this mechanic. However, if an Oracle is left alive, it will disappear after some time and apply the Marked for Negation Debuff on all players. Furthermore, the current wave will reset and the Fireteam will have to repeat the wave.
</br>
</br>
Like the way it was dealt before in the Defend the Confluxes Encounter, the Pool of Light remains in the centre of the room and walking into it will cleanse you and remove the Marked for Negation Debuff. It still has a limited use, so failing an Oracle wave too many times will eventually lead to the Pool of Light running out and wiping your team.
</p>
<img src="vogDTO6.jpg" alt="Hobgoblins">
<p>
After the Templar has finished casting the Ritual of Negation, there will be a grace period before the next Oracle wave spawns, giving you and your Fireteam the chance to regroup and collect ammo. Keep in mind that there will still be Goblins and Hobgoblins spawning, so keep an eye on your surroundings. After a brief time later, the next Oracle wave will begin.
</br>
</br>
After completing the fourth and final wave of Oracles, the Templar will disappear and the Encounter will be complete.

	<p>Unlike Defend the Confluxes, the Destroy the Oracles Encounter throws you directly into the enemy's line of sight. The Oracles that spawn need to be killed as quickly as possible, and you cannot afford to sit and defend the chokehold points like you did before. However, that doesn't mean to say you can go full Leeroy and charge at the enemy with no regrets.
	</br>
	</br>
	The Hobgoblins in this part deal an insane amount of damage and are very often the main cause of team wipes in this Encounter. Because of this, it is recommended that you take them as effectively as possible. Furthermore, you also have to worry about their armour lock state, which leaves them invulnerable for three seconds if almost killed. To combat this, either shoot their heads off (which isn't recommend because you create rapid-firing monsters) or get a single critical kill on them. 
	</br>
	</br>
	Finally, do not be afraid to use your Super if things get a little too hectic. Minotaurs and Goblins hit hard, so dealing with them in an instant is far better than trickling them down as the Encounter goes on.

	<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
	<h3>Lore</h3>
	<h4>With its servants defeated and Oracles destroyed, the Templar now fully comprehends the threat that the Guardian's pose to the Vault of Glass and Hezen Corrective. Reaching the conclusion that only direct intervention can expunge the Guardian threat, the Templar now enters the frontline. Its power great and shield unbreakable, the Axis Mind sees no other reality than your eventual demise.
</br>
</br>
However, even in the darkest recesses of the Vault, Hope still burns bright. For by Kabr's hand, a shield was forged to face against the Hezen Corrective and the might of the Templar.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>As the first boss of the Vault of Glass, the Templar is a formidable opponent that must not be underestimated. Like all Ultra-Class Hydras, the Templar possesses powerful void attacks and can kill a Guardian in a matter of seconds. What makes the Templar especially dangerous however, is its impenetrable shield.
</br>
</br>
Before the Fireteam can deal damage to the Templar, its shield must first be brought done. This can only be done using the Aegis' Super Ability, the Light Volley. One its shields have been brought down, players are able to damage the Hydra.
</br>
</br>
Throughout the fight, the Templar will summon waves of Harpies to overwhelm your Fireteam, so it is crucial that you are aware of your surroundings always. Furthermore, the Templar will attempt to teleport to various parts of the room, which can be successfully blocked if timed right. If players fail to block the Teleport, the Templar will regain its invulnerability shield and the Fireteam must once again work to remove it using the Aegis. If however, players successfully block the teleport, the Templar will remain in place and summon a series of Minotaurs to assist it. A few seconds later, the Templar will attempt to teleport again.
</br>
</br>
Once players have dealt enough damage to the Templar, the Hydra will be destroyed and the Encounter will end.
</br>
</br>
The Templar is a Darkness Zone Boss Fight, so Respawn Restrictions are put in place. They are as follows:
</p>
<h4>Normal Mode: 30-Second Respawn Time
</br>(Requires another Player to Revive)
</br>
</br>
Hard Mode: No Revive
</br>
</br>
390LL Mode: No Revive

<h3 style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFF700;">Exotic of the Encounter</h3>
<p>Out of all the Ultra-Class enemies in Destiny, the Templar is one of the most defensive in the game. Boasting a large health pool and an extremely small critical spot, the Templar on its own is a formidable force. Many weapons like the Sleeper Simulant and Hezen Vengeance will only do ample damage in certain scenarios. 
</br>
</br>
The Gjallarhorn, however, can deal damage that is both consistent and high. This is thanks to the Gjallarhorn's intrinsic perk, Wolfpack Rounds, which increases the amount of damage the Exotic can deal quite largely. Furthermore, the Gjallarhorn's lock-on projectiles make it easy to hit a floating target like the Templar.

<h3>Encounter Map</h3>
<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">

<img src="vogTT3.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>Before the Templar Encounter begins, you will have time to plan and co-ordinate your intended strategy with your Fireteam. Additionally, you can take this time to recompose yourself and also reload you weapons. The Templar Encounter will not start until someone picks up the Aegis.
</br>
</br>
For this fight, you will want to designate one member of your Fireteam to be the 'Relic Runner', the player using the Aegis. For the entirety of this fight, the Relic Runner will be working towards destroying Oracles, assisting teammates, removing the Templar's shields and possibly blocking teleports. One thing that the Relic Runner should be aware of, however, is the mechanic that activates whenever the player has dropped the Aegis. 
</br>
</br>
When the Aegis is dropped, a notification tooltip will appear on the bottom-left of the screen stating that 'The Aegis has been dropped.'. If a player does not pick up the Aegis within 5 seconds of it being dropped, the Aegis will despawn and the entire team will wipe. You can tell when this is about to happen, as the screen will begin to darken red as the seconds go by.
</p>
<img src="vogTT4.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>As for the other members of your team, it is their job to deal with the Templar and the additionals (adds) that spawn alongside it. How you go about approaching this is completely up to you and your team.
</br>
</br>
When the Aegis has been picked up, the Templar will reappear at the centre of the map. Still sporting its barrier, it cannot be harmed by normal gunfire. To disable it, the Relic Runner will need to wait until his/her Super is charged. During this time, the Templar will begin to summon Vex Harpies into the fight to disrupt your team. Furthemore, the Templar will also begin spawning Oracles at various parts of the room to kill you with the Ritual of Negation. Thankfully, the Aegis' shield ability also has a cleanse effect, which will remove the Marked for Negation Debuff on any players standing inside the shield. As for the Oracles themselves, they will spawn in the same locations as the ones found in the Destroy the Oracles Encounter.
</br>
</br>
It is advised to destroy two waves of these Oracles before removing the Templar's shield, as prematurely removing the barrier can complicate the order of the fight (this will be explained below). After this is successfully done, signal the Relic Runner to disable the shield and wait for the Templar's barrier to go down. 
</p>
<img src="vogTT2.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>Once the Templar's barrier has been removed, three random players within your Fireteam will now be affected with a Debuff called 'Detain'. Detain will drastically slow the affected player's movement speed, as well as creating a breakable shield around them. Should the affected player move out of the shield, they will begin taking damage and quickly die as a result. To counteract this mechanic, the affected player and/or their teammates need to shoot the barrier with non-explosive weapons like Hand Cannons and Shotguns. If a player uses a rocket inside the barrier, the resulting splash damage will instantly kill the player.
</br>
</br>
When all players are free for their detainment, their focus should now be on the Templar. Without its barrier, the Templar is now exposed and can take ordinary weapon damage. In this instant, everyone except the Relic Runner should equip their heaviest damage-dealing weapons, activate their offensive supers and completely lay into the Templar. However, the Templar will attempt to reactivate its barrier and this is done using Teleports.
</p>
<img src="vogTT5.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>When the Templar is ready to regain its strength, a notification on the bottom-left that reads 'The Templar is attempting to Teleport!' will appear. On various parts of the map, a circular indicator will be highlighted. These are places where the Templar will teleport to and after a ten second countdown, the Templar will either successfully or unsuccessfully teleport to this designated spot. There is a way to counteract this mechanic, and this involves standing in the place where the Templar intends to teleport to.
</br>
</br>
When a player stands inside this teleportation circle for three seconds, the red marker will become white and indicate that the teleport spot is successfully blocked. However, the player will need to remain inside this circle until it disappears in order for this to work. Furthermore, when a teleportation circle has been marked as Blocked, the Templar will draw its aggro towards any players inside the circle, as well as firing a lethal barrage of Void Rockets at them.
</p>
<img src="vogTT6.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>After the Teleport has been successfully blocked, the Templar will remain where he is and summon a group of Minotaurs into the map, which will be stated on the bottom-left screen below. Once a few more seconds have passed, the Templar will attempt to teleport to a different spot and the cycle of teleport blocking will repeat. Should players fail to block the Teleport, however, the Templar will phase into its desired spot and regain its barrier. After this, it will once again summon its Oracles and continue to do so until its barrier is removed again by the Aegis' Super. The procedure for what to do before and after removing the shield should remain the same as before (destroy two Oracle waves, callout Aegis Super, wait for Detain debuff to expire, etc).
</br>
</br>
These mechanics will persist throughout the fight and will not stop until either your Fireteam is dead or the Templar. When the Templar has been successfully destroyed, the Encounter will end.

	<h3>Hard Mode & 390 LL Mode 
	</br>Changes</h3>
	<p>The Templar Encounter remains largely unchanged mechanics-wise, save for the Oracles. In the Hard and 390 LL versions of The Templar, TWO RED Oracles will spawn in various parts of the map, instead of ONE YELLOW Oracle.
</br>
</br>
Unlike Yellow Oracles, which can be countered easily by the Aegis' Shield Cleanse effect, the Red Oracles will apply the 'Prophecy of Doom' debuff on the player when successfully activated. This debuff will quickly drain your fireteam's super energy, before instantly killing you. Because of this, it is extremely important that you and Fireteam destroy these Oracles as swiftly as possible.

	<h3>Challenge Mode </h3>
	<p>When the Vault of Glass is the Weekly Featured Raid of Destiny, the Templar Challenge will become active. Completing the Challenge's requirements when it is active will grant all players in the Fireteam additional loots, as well as a chance at receiving Exotic Adept Weapons, exclusive to the Challenge Modes.
</p>
<h4>
The Templar Challenge: Block ALL the Templar's Teleports.
</h4>
<p>
For this Challenge to be complete, the Fireteam must block ALL of the Templar's Teleports. This means that whenever the Templar attempts to Teleport to a certain spot, that area must be blocked by a player all the time. Failure to do this will lead to the Templar teleporting, which will fail the Challenge.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>As the Vault of Glass was designed to be the most challenging Destiny experience back in its release, the Templar was built to be a formidable opponent. Because of this, players should never underestimate the strength of this Ultra-Class Hydra.
</br>
</br>
The best recommendation for defeating the Templar is to kill him as quickly as possible. The sooner the Templar is defeated, the easier the fight is. While the success of the Encounter depends entirely on the abilities of the Relic Runner, there is also the amount of damage a Fireteam can deal. The less damage a Fireteam can deal to the Templar, the greater the chance that the Relic Runner and/or your team will quickly become overwhelmed by Harpies and Minotaurs.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>
The Gorgon's Labyrinth is an Encounter unlike the others found in the Vault of Glass. Unlike the ones before that test your skills as a fight, this Encounter tests your patience and determination. The Gorgon's Labyrinth is a dark maze filled with terrible Ultra-Class Harpies known as the Gorgons. Unlike other Harpies that you've met, Gorgons will not attack you. Instead, when a Gorgon sees you, you will have ten seconds to kill it or your entire team will wipe. These monsters patrol the dark mazes of the Labyrinth, searching endlessly for any threats. The objective of this Encounter is not to defeat them, but instead navigate carefully through the maze and find the hidden exit. Once your team locates the exit and all players make it through the Labyrinth safely, the Encounter ends.

<p>While the objective of the Encounter is simply to escape, there's no telling when a Gorgon might spot a poorly positioned player. When this happens, the only way to prevent a wipe at this moment is to kill the Gorgon that spotted you. Gorgons however, have a large health-pool and require an immense level of damage to take it down. Thankfully, because they are an Ultra-Class enemy, the Dark Drinker works wonders here. With the additional damage it deals to Ultras and the fact that Gorgons cannot shoot, you will have no problem dealing with a Gorgon with a Dark Drinker in your arsenal.

<h3>Guide (Normal Mode):</h3>
<p>
Before even entering the Gorgon's Labyrinth, there are a series of long chasms that players must descend into to reach it. There are two ways of entering the Gorgon's Labyrinth. The first is to take the Vex Door that is located behind where the Templar first spawned in the Templar's Well. Simply following this pathway will eventually lead you to a giant chasm, where you will have to jump down and survive the fall. After safely landing, continuing forward will eventually lead you to the Gorgon's Labyrinth's Darkness Zone checkpoint.
</br>
</p>
<img src="vogGL12.jpg" alt="Destroy the Oracles Map">
<p>
Alternatively, you may choose to take the second secret passage for a chance at extra rewards. By entering the hidden path pictured above, players will gain access to a small chest containing One Spirit Bloom Material. Simple continue descending the dark chasms and you will eventually arrive at another room with another Chest. This chest however contains more valuable rewards, like the ones found at the Trial of Kabr. Keep in mind however that the chasms are very dark and confusing to navigate, so always keep a close eye on your surroundings for possible alternate pathways. After opening the chest, continue onwards through the dark caverns and you will eventually arrive at the Gorgon's Labyrinth Darkness Zone.
</br>
</br>
When you arrive in the Darkness Zone of the Gorgon's Labyrinth, your objective is simple. Find the hidden exit and escape the Gorgon's Labyrinth. This is easier said than done however, as you will have to deal with the Gorgons.
</p>
<img src="vogGL8.jpg" alt="Destroy the Oracles Map">
<p>
Gorgons are passive Harpies that will patrol certain areas of the Labyrinth in a set pattern. The Encounter Map pictured above specifically details these patrol routes. They have a poor line of sight and make a distinct sound when moving about. This speed of this noise will grow faster and faster the closer a player is to them. Because of this, it is best to keep your distance from a Gorgon.
</br>
</br>
However, this does not mean to say you should just run past them. Whenever a player jumps, sprints or fires their weapon, they will be alerted to that position and temporarily break their patrol path to investigate the source of that noise the player just emitted. After a few seconds, the Gorgon will ignore the noise and continue with its patrol.
</p>
<img src="vogGL6.jpg" alt="Destroy the Oracles Map">
<p>
Should a player be spotted by a Gorgon, things become complicated fast. When a Gorgon spots you, it will enter a defensive state and cast an ability called 'Gorgon's Gaze'. This is a 10-Second long channelled ability that will wipe your entire fireteam when it has successfully been cast. The only way to interrupt this ability is to kill the Gorgon that spotted a player. To kill this specific Gorgon, all members of the Fireteam will need to use all their damage-dealing weapons and abilities. Each Gorgon has a massive health pool and will require everyone working together to take it down. Once a Gorgon has been killed, the debuff will expire and you will have one less Gorgon to worry about.

For those of you who want to risk it, there is a secret chest hidden within the Labyrinth that involves players having to take an alternate route. The path to this chest is included in the image above. One thing to note however is that when a Gorgon spots a player, the door to this chest will immediately close and anyone inside will be instantly killed. This effect will expire when either the Gorgon or the Fireteam is dead.
</p>
<img src="vogGL11.jpg" alt="Destroy the Oracles Map">
<p>
After sneaking past various Gorgons, you will arrive at the hidden exit of the Labyrinth as pictured above. Once all members of your Fireteam have made it through this hidden pathway, you will no longer be in the Gorgon's line of sight and you will have effectively completed this Encounter.
</p>

<h3>Guide (Hard Mode):</h3>
<img src="glMap2.jpg" alt="Destroy the Oracles Map">
<p>In the Hard Mode and 390 LL Mode of the Gorgon's Labyrinth, four additional Gorgons will be in the Labyrinth. Unlike the ones found on Normal Mode, these Gorgons have no patrol pathing. Instead, they will remain stationery on various parts of the Labyrinth. The location of them, as well as the Hard Mode patrol map is pictured above.
</br>
</br>
The position of these Gorgons presents a problem, as players will need to be extra careful when walking through certain pathways as players may accidentally run into the line of sight of two Gorgons instead of one, which will effectively instantly wipe your team. Additionally, patrolling Gorgons may overlap with stationery ones, so being aware of the timing of these patrol routes is essential.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>The objective of this Encounter is simply to escape the Labyrinth, so time and patience is key. Preferably, have you and your Fireteam move as one large group and always wait if one of you falls behind. It's better that you remain safe as a group, rather than wipe because you left one guy in the hands of hungry Gorgons.
</br>
</br>
Additionally, if you have any Nightstalker Hunters, have them equip the â€˜Vanish in Smoke' perk in their subclass menu. Turning you and your allies invisible is absolutely invaluable for this part as it will allow you to move undetected for a few seconds, even if you are in direct line of sight of a Gorgon. This also applies to any Exotic or Subclass abilities that grant you invisibility.
</br>
</br>
Finally, there is the â€˜Blind Labyrinth' Medal for the Age of Triumph Book. To get this, you and your Fireteam will need to kill ALL the Gorgons in the Gorgon's Labyrinth in the 390LL Version of the Vault of Glass Raid. Doing this is completely optional, but this medal helps you progress in obtaining the elusive â€˜Valor in Darkness' emblem for your character.

	<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
	<h3>Lore</h3>
	<h4>After defeating the Templar and escaping the Gorgon's Labyrinth, you and fireteam finally arrive at the heart of the Vault of Glass. Here, all timelines merge and intertwine with each other, forming possibilities that would have been otherwise impossible to comprehend. The Hezen Corrective rallies its allies, both Precursors and Descendants, to fight for the absolute of the Pattern. To orchestrate this, the Vex Collective Mind has enlisted the help of the Gatekeepers. These Axis Mind Hydras watch over the Gates to the past and future, ensuring no anomalous factors disrupt their plans.
</br>
</br>
However, the light of Kabr shines bright through the darkness of Vex time and you and your Fireteam will once again need to wield to Aegis if you are to survive the Hezen Corrective's onslaught.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>As the second-to-last Encounter of the Vault of Glass, the Gatekeepers requires co-ordination, massive firepower and an excellent sense of your surroundings.
</br>
</br>
There are three unique Major-Class Hydras known as the Gatekeepers that must be destroyed, but doing so is easier said than done. These Hydras are located in three separate areas of the fight. The first is located within the room you begin the encounter in. The second, the Precursor Gatekeeper, is found within the Mars realm and the third, the Descendant Gatekeeper, is found in the Venus realm.
</br>
</br>
When a Gatekeeper is destroyed, it will drop an Aegis at the back of the arena. Your Fireteam must collect all three Aegis relics to progress with the Encounter, so you must decide who on your team will wield the Aegis relics and who will provide supporting fire. Once all three Aegis relics have been retrieved, a Vex Conflux will spawn in the middle of the map and must be defended from a series of Minotaurs, both regular and Major-Class. After a few seconds of fending them, the Conflux will disappear and the Encounter will end.
</br>
</br>
The Gatekeepers is a Darkness Zone Boss Fight, so Respawn Restrictions are put in place. They are as follows:
</p>
<h4>Normal Mode: 30-Second Respawn Time
</br>(Requires another Player to Revive)
</br>
</br>
Hard Mode: No Revive
</br>
</br>
390LL Mode: No Revive

<h3 style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFF700;">Exotic of the Encounter</h3>
<p>Gatekeepers are formidable opponents and can easily kill a player if left unprotected. Furthermore, the Gatekeepers Encounter also contains several Major-Class Goblins, Hobgoblins, Minotaurs and Praetorians that must be disposed of quickly before they overwhelm your team. 
</br>
</br> 
The Gjallarhorn provides you with powerful burst damage that is capable of severely weakening any Major-Class enemies in this Encounter. Bear in mind however, that the Vault of Glass arena is filled with many tight spaces, so keeping a close look on your surroundings is vital, lest you accidentally shoot yourself with this monster.

<h3>Guide:</h3>
<p>
<img src="vogGK3.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
</br>
Before entering the final arena, you must continue through the dark caverns underneath the Gorgon's Labyrinth until you reach a room with a large chasm. When all players have entered the area, your Fireteam will be presented with a series of floating platforms that disappear and reappear occasionally. Your team will have to jump across them safely, until you reach the other side of the chasm. This area is NOT a Darkness Zone, so you will not have to worry about wiping in this section. Once all members of your Fireteam have reached the other side of the chasm, proceed to room pictured above and you will begin this Encounter.
</p>
<img src="vogGK5.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Upon entering the Vault of Glass room, players will spot a series of inactive enemies, including a single Gatekeeper. These enemies will not engage you, until you are detected by one or fire your weapons. On doing, the enemies in this Encounter will reactivate and begin their assault.
</p>
<img src="vogGK4.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Your objective here is to destroy the Gatekeeper, a unique, Major-Class Hydra that randomly teleports throughout the room, dealing damage whenever it's in a player's line-of-sight. Doing this, however is not your primary concern. Providing supporting fire for the Gatekeeper, a large amount of Vex Goblins and Hobgoblins will attempt to pick off any players that are caught out of position. Standing alongside them are the Precursors and Descendants, alternate Major-Class Vex enemies that sport unique models and protect the Vex Gates. The white Vex, the Precursors, defend the left side of the arena, whereas the black Vex, the Descendants, defend the right side. All Major-Class, especially the Hobgoblins must be picked off before you engage the Gatekeeper.
</br>
</br>
After these enemies have been disposed of, your attention must now be on the Gatekeeper. This enemy will randomly teleport to five areas of the room, which are:
</p>

<h4>
Left
</br>
</br>
Right
</br>
</br>
Front Middle
</br>
</br>
Middle Middle
</br>
</br>
Back Middle
</h4>
</p>
<img src="gatekeeper.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Gatekeepers, unlike regular Hydras, do not possess any shielding so damage them with your weapons is simple. However, Gatekeepers sport powerful Void-based Mortar blasts that can severely weaken or kill a player if ignored. Furthermore, Vex Goblins will continually spawn at the back of the room and must be managed before they overwhelm your Fireteam. Keep firing your weapons at the Gatekeeper until it has been destroyed.
</p>
<img src="vogGK6.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
After the Gatekeeper has been destroyed, an Aegis Relic will spawn in the middle of the room. Assign one member of your Fireteam to this Relic and have them return to the area of the room where you started the Encounter.
</p>
<img src="vogGK7.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Now, your Fireteam's objective is to destroy the other two Gatekeepers. However, these Gatekeepers remain hidden from you in separate play-spaces, in this case, Venus and Mars. To destroy these Gatekeepers, you will need to open the corresponding Vex gates to those realms.
</p>
<img src="vogGK8.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Like the beginning Encounter of the Vault of Glass, Constructing the Spire, there are Sync Plates that players must utilize. Unlike the former, however, there are only two Sync Plates in this Encounter. Located in the images are the locations of the two Sync Plates:
</br>
</br>
Located on the left side of the arena is the Mars Portal, and should be the portal to open first. Have a player or two stand on this Sync Plate and wait until it is fully active. Once this happens, a Vex Gate will open and allow players to venture inside the anomalous time realm. However, two or three players will need to wait outside of the Vex Gate and ensure that the Sync Plate remains active. If the Sync Plate becomes deactivated, the Vex Gate will close, preventing players from entering inside, or escaping. To stop you, the Hezen Corrective once again sends its Praetorians to deactivate the Plates. The three players standing guard of them must dispatch these Praetorians quickly, before they reach the Plates. Additionally, a series of Goblins and Hobgoblins will spawn alongside the Praetorians to provide supporting fire.
</p>
<img src="vogGK10.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
The other three players, specifically two damage-dealers and the Aegis Relic holder must enter the Vex Gate once it is fully open. Once inside, you will notice the Gatekeeper, a large quantity of enemies and a particularly nasty debuff known as â€˜Marked by the Void'. This debuff when active will slowly blind the player's screen, turning it black. Once the screen has become fully enveloped in darkness, the player affected with it with shortly die instantly. To avoid this terrible fate, the players inside will need to stand near the Relic Holder. The Aegis' shield mechanic applies a â€˜Cleanse' effect to anyone inside, removing the Marked by the Void debuff from them. Keep in mind that as long as you are inside the Mars and Venus realms, the debuff will continually be applied to the players until they exit the Vex Gate and return to the normal arena to regroup with the other players.
</p>
<img src="vogGK13.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Like dealing with the Gatekeeper from before, the Mars Precursor Gatekeepers will need to be destroyed quickly and effectively. The Relic Holder will need to provide supporting cover and Cleanse the other players inside a portal occasionally, so that the Marked by the Void debuff does not become unbearable to deal with. After the Gatekeeper is destroyed, a series of Precursor Minotaurs will spawn that must be destroyed, as well as another Aegis Relic at the back of the room. Once these enemies are gone, assign one of the players inside to this Aegis Relic, then have all player inside the Mars Gate escape back into the main arena.
</br>
</br>
Once those players have returned from the Mars Gate, the players defending the Sync Plate can now step of it and proceed to the other side of the room to open the next Vex Gate on the right, the Venus Gate. Before moving to this Gate however, you will need to assign roles for the two Aegis Relic Holders. The first Relic Runner will need to go inside the Venus Gate with two other players, while the second Relic Runner will need to go to the back of the room and deal with a series of continually spawning additionals (adds) to prevent them overwhelming the players defending the Sync Plate.
</p>
<img src="vogGK11.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
The process for opening the Venus Gate is the same as the Mars Gate, but do not attempt to save time by sending all players through the Gate. When all six players are inside either the Venus or Mars realms and nobody is outside to hold the Sync Plate, your team will quickly lose their Super Energy and your team will instantly wipe. With that said, the procedure for dealing with the Venus Realm is the same as before. Have three players, including the Relic Holder, enter the Venus Gate and deal with the Descendant Gatekeeper and its additionals. Once it has been defeated, two Descendant Hobgoblins will spawn, as well as an Aegis Relic. Dispose of these Hobgoblins and assign one of the two players that doesn't have an Aegis with the third one. Once the Aegis has been collected, make your way out of the Venus Gate and return to your team defending the Sync Plate.
</br>
</br>
After all players have returned to the regular realm and all three Aegis Relics are in the hands of your Fireteam, have all of your team members move to the centre of the room. A Vex Conflux will spawn, and the two Vex Gates to Venus and Mars will reopen, as well as a spawning point for enemies at the back of the room. Assign each Relic Holder to one of these spawn points and have them keep watch of the enemy spawns. The other three players should keep watch and provide supporting fire, as well as pick off any enemies near the Conflux. Like the Defend the Confluxes Encounter, if too many enemies enter the Conflux, the Fireteam will receive the Expunged debuff and instantly wipe.
</p>
<img src="vogGK1.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
After a few seconds, normal Minotaurs will spawn in the back of the room, whilst Precursor and Descendant Minotaurs will appear from their respective portals. Deal with them as best as you, so as to not complicate things for your team. One important thing to note here is that you shouldn't push the Precursors and Descendants back into the Vex Gates. Doing so will cause them to teleport instantly towards the Conflux and attempt to sacrifice themselves. These Major-Class Minotaurs are extremely tough to take down, so deal with them as quickly as you can.
</br>
</br>
After half a minute of dealing with these enemies, the Conflux will disappear, the Minotaurs will leave and the Encounter will end.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>Familiarize yourself with the environment here, as this arena will be the final area of the Vault of Glass raid. This includes the layout of the Mars and Venus maps, as you will be playing in them for both this Encounter and the Final Boss.
</br>
</br>
The Gatekeepers in an Encounter that is considered simple to do compared to the Templar and the Gorgon's Labyrinth, but still can go horribly wrong if even one player is unaware of certain mechanics. An example of this is the mechanic when a player drops the Relic, where if the Aegis is not picked up within 5 seconds of dropping it, the entire team will wipe. This is especially important to consider, as there are THREE Aegis Relics that spawn during this Encounter, so keeping these three players alive is paramount.
</br>
</br>
Additionally, if one of the players in your Fireteam is a Hunter and has the Celestial Nighthawk Exotic, they can potentially Solo a Vex Realm, as one CNH Golden Gun shot can instantly kill a Gatekeeper. In this quick time, the Hunter can quickly grab the Aegis and leave, without having to worry about the additional enemies that spawn.

</br>
<img src="vogATC4.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>As the ultimate enemy and Final Encounter of the Vault of Glass, Atheon is a formidable enemy unlike any you have seen before.
</br>
</br>
When the fight begins, you will notice that Atheon will hardly take any damage. Atheon, unlike the Templar, is not invulnerable and instead possesses a massive health-pool. In this state, Atheon is impervious to weapon fire.
</p>
<img src="vogATC7.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
After a few seconds of waiting, Atheon will open up the Vex timestream and teleport three random players in your Fireteam to either Venus or Mars. Inside, a Aegis Relic will spawn and one of the three players teleported inside will need to equip and use it throughout the Encounter. Inside Venus/Mars, six Red Oracles will spawn in sequential order and MUST be destroyed before the Prophecy of Doom debuff is applied. While this is happening, the players inside the Venus/Mars realm must deal with both the Precursor/Descendant Vex inside and the Marked by the Void debuff.
</br>
</br>
As for the players who were not teleported, their mission is to open up respective Vex Gate of the realm the rest of the Fireteam were teleported to, as well as deal with continuous waves of Supplicants.
</p>
<img src="vogATC8.jpg" alt="VOG TT Image 1">
<p>
Once all Six RED Oracles have been destroyed, a tooltip will appear at the bottom of the screen that staes 'Guardians make their own fate.'. When this happens, all players will receive a buff known as Time's Vengeance. This buff will massively increase your weapon, while instantly giving you Super Energy for the duration the buff is active, allowing to constantly use your Super Abilities.
</br>
</br>
After Time's Vengeance expires, Atheon will once again teleport three players to either Vex or Mars and the process from before will repeat. This will continue until Atheon is destroyed, and when that happens, the Encounter will be complete and you will have finished the Vault of Glass Raid.
</br>
</br>
Atheon, Time's Conflux is a Darkness Zone Boss Fight, so Respawn Restrictions are put in place. They are as follows:
</p>
<h4>Normal Mode: 30-Second Respawn Time
</br>(Requires another Player to Revive)
</br>
</br>
Hard Mode: No Revive
</br>
</br>
390LL Mode: No Revive

<h3 style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFF700;">Exotic of the Encounter</h3>
<p>Time's Vengeance is a unique buff that offers an extreme boost damage to a player's weapons, but most Exotic weapons like the Gjallarhorn and Outbreak Prime are not suitable for dealing massive damage to Atheon in this short duration. The one weapon that can annihilate Time's Conflux is the Sleeper Simulant. Boasting massive single-target damage and excellent handling, this Exotic Fusion Rifle is superb for dealing damage to Atheon, especially if any of its shots hit the Minotaurs critical spot. Furthermore, the Sleeper is good for dealing with Oracles if you are teleported inside either Venus or Mars. Bear in mind, however that the Sleeper's bouncing shots may accidentally kill you if you shoot the Oracle from an awkward angle. Nevertheless, the Sleeper is the undisputed king of damaging Atheon, Time's Conflux.

<h3>Guide (Normal Mode):</h3>
<p>On starting the Encounter, Atheon, Time's Conflux will spawn at the back of the room and make its way towards the middle of the arena. During this time, split your team into two groups of three to cover both the Venus and Mars Sync Plates. This is to ensure that your team will be prepared for when Atheon opens the time stream. During this time, stay out of Atheon's line-of-sight as the Ultra-Class Minotaur can easily kill a team with his powerful Void Bolt attacks.
</br>
</br>
After some time, a subtext will appear at the bottom of the screen that states â€˜Atheon opens the timestream'. Seconds later, three random members of your Fireteam will either be teleported towards the Venus or Mars realm. The other three players who were not teleported will remain where they are. When the â€˜Away' team identifies what realm they are in, it is imperative that they callout to the â€˜Plate' team where they are, so the latter can make their way towards that respective realm's Sync Plate. At this time, Atheon will no longer move or attack the players.
</p>
<img src="vogATC9.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
A few seconds after spawning inside, an Aegis Relic will appear in the realm. One of the three players inside must equip it and make their way through the realm. As time passes, a series of RED Oracles will begin to spawn around the room. It is up to the other players inside to destroy them before the Prophecy of Doom is applied to your team and wiping you. While this is happening, there are a few additional mechanics that the â€˜Away' team must be aware along the way.
</p>
<img src="vogATC10.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
Inside the Mars realm, there are three Precursor Hobgoblins at the bottom of the stairs. Ideally, the player carrying the Aegis will want to sneak up on these enemies and take them out with either one big slam attack, or a series of well-timed strikes. By soloing these Hobgoblins, the Relic Runner ensures that his two team members focus on destroying the Oracles. Furthermore, the Marked by the Void debuff will continually be applied to everyone inside the realm, so the Relic Runner will need to group up with the rest of the â€˜Away' team and â€˜Cleanse' everyone.
</p>
<img src="vogATC6.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
Inside the Venus realm, there will be three Descendant Goblins and one Descendant Minotaur. Unlike the Mars realm, the Relic Runner cannot solo kill all of these enemies. For this reason, it is recommended that one of the two players in the â€˜Away' team that is not carrying the Aegis offers supporting fire, via Weaponry or Grenades.
</p>
<img src="supplicant.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
For the â€˜Plate' team, they will need to group on the Sync Plate for the Vex Gate of the realm the â€˜Away' team are currently trapped in. Once they arrive, the Sync Plate will need to become fully activated to ensure the Gate is open for the â€˜Away' team. During this time, however, Atheon will summon hordes of Supplicant Harpies to kill anyone on the â€˜Plate' team. For this reason, the â€˜Plate' team must keep an eye out for this Supplicants and ensure they do not get too close to them and the Vex Gate.
</br>
</br>
After destroying the sixth and final Oracle inside the time realm, all Guardians will receive the text stating that â€˜Guardians make their own fate' and receive the buff known as Time's Vengeance. It is a 25-second long damage-boosting buff that multiplies player damage by x10, and Super Ability damage by x3. Furthermore, all Grenade, Melee and Super Energy is instantly recharged while the buff is active, allowing for players to continuously use their abilities on Atheon.
</p>
<img src="vogATC3.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
Once this buff is active, all six players (including the Relic Runner) will need to converge on the floating central platform in the middle of the room in front of Atheon. Foremost, the player wielding the Aegis must continuously use its shield to defend their team from both Atheon and the Supplicants' attacks. Because Time's Vengeance is active, the Relic Runner will not have to worry about their shield energy running out. The rest of the Fireteam must use all their highest damage-dealing weapons and Super abilities to deal as much damage as they can to Atheon, before Time's Vengeance ends.
</br>
</br>
Once Time's Vengeance only has five seconds left, everyone except the Aegis Holder must hop off the platform and return to the Sync Plate sides they were assigned to during the start of the Encounter. In the time that these players have remaining, the Supplicants surrounding the area should be destroyed. Once Time's Vengeance is nearly expired, the Relic Runner should quickly return to his/her and prepare for the next timestream phase.
</p>
<img src="vogATC5.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
<p>
After Time's Vengeance ends, Atheon will once again teleport three random players to Venus or Mars and the process for damaging Atheon will repeat as normal until Time's Conflux has been destroyed. Once the Ultra-Class Minotaur has been destroyed, the Encounter will be complete and players will have finished the Vault of Glass Raid.

	<img src="vogATC11.jpg" alt="Templar Picture">
	<h3>Hard Mode & 390 LL Mode 
	</br>Changes</h3>
	<p>The Atheon, Time's Conflux Encounter remains largely unchanged in the Hard and 390 LL versions of the Vault of Glass raid, save for an additional mechanic for players that were not teleported to either Venus or Mars. After the timestream has been opened, all three members of the â€˜Plate' team will become detained, much like the detainment debuff worked in the Templar fight.
</br>
</br>
This debuff can be especially dangerous for these players as the severely reduced movement and barrier it provides make them vulnerable to the Supplicants and their detonation ability. To avoid his untimely fate, make sure to equip a weapon that can easily dispatch this barrier, as well as help any players struggling to destroy theirs.
</br>
</br>
Finally, if one or two players on your Fireteam have died, two players in the â€˜Away' team will become detained upon teleportation. Thankfully however, the player carrying the Aegis will have no issue dealing with these.

	<h3>Challenge Mode </h3>
	<p>When the Vault of Glass is the Weekly Featured Raid of Destiny, the Atheon Challenge will become active. Completing the Challenge's requirements when it is active will grant all players in the Fireteam additional loot, as well as a chance at receiving Exotic Adept Weapons, exclusive to the Challenge Modes.
</p>
<h4>
The Atheon Challenge: ALL Six players must destroy only ONE Oracle during the Timestream Phase.
</h4>
<p>
Arguably the most difficult Raid Challenge Mode in Destiny, only one Oracle can be destroyed by the players. Because a total of SIX Oracles spawn in each realm, players will need communicate quickly who will destroy what Oracle. Because only one Oracle can be destroyed by a player, three of them must be dealt with by the â€˜Plate' team members. To deal with this, the respective Vex Gate must be opened as soon as possible, with two people entering the portal shortly after its opening, leaving one person behind.
</br>
</br>
As for the â€˜Away' team, once their Oracles have been destroyed, the players without the Aegis must exit the Vex Gate and defend the Plate. The player with the Aegis must remain inside the realm, by the Gate to cleanse the players that are both leaving and entering. Once the two players from the â€˜Away' team escape the realm, they must defend the Sync Plate from the Supplicants, allowing the player initially keeping the Gate to go inside and destroy the sixth and final Oracle. Once all Oracles have been successfully destroyed this way, Time's Vengeance will proceed and the fight will continue as normal.
</br>
</br>
If one player accidentally destroyed two Oracles, the Challenge will fail and you will not be eligible to earn the exclusive rewards.

	<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	<p>
As the Final Boss of the Vault of Glass Raid, Atheon is a formidable opponent. His powerful Void-based attacks can shred through a player's shields with ease and his presence itself is intimidating. However, the difficulty of this fight comes from how quickly players will need to deal with the mechanics. Everything must be achieved to almost-perfect timing, otherwise your team will most likely wipe to Oracles, poor damage or Supplicants (a note will display to the rest of your team when a player has died to a Supplicant).
</br>
</br>
Challenge Mode only triples the difficulty of this fight, as the coordination needed by everyone is insane. Everyone needs to be right on point in such a small amount of time. With that said, because the fight goes so quickly, Atheon is rather easy to take down once the Time's Vengeance buff is active. Just remember to always play it safe rather than try to go for that godly â€˜One-Phase',
</br>
</br>
Oh, and finally, for the Challenge Mode, make sure that all the â€˜Plate' team don't run in while the â€˜Away' team is still dealing with their Oracles. It's not very fun being lost in time and wiping.

	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<h4>Congratulations!</h4>
<p>
If you're reading this, you've successfully completed all the Encounters in the Vault of Glass Raid and have obtained all of your glorious loot!
</br>
</br>
So the question remainsâ€¦ Why not do it again?
</br>
</br>
Destiny Raids reset their rewards every single week on Tuesday, so if you've already run the Vault of Glass and didn't get the Weapon or God Roll Armour Piece, try again when the Weekly Reset comes. Furthermore, you can run the Vault of Glass with two other characters as for even more rewards. This is all completely up to you.
</br>
</br>
So what benefits did running the Vault of Glass bring?
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
</br>
<img src="vog2.jpg" alt="VOG Introduction Image 2">
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>The Vault of Glass arguably contains some of the game's most powerful Primary Weapons, specifically the Fatebringer and the Vision of Confluence. While secondary and heavy weapons such as Praedyth's Revenge and Corrective Measure are gimmicky at beast and are only really useful inside the Vault of Glass, the primaries can be used successfully in almost all of the game's other game-modes.
</p>
</br>
<img src="vogBox.jpg" alt="VOG Box">
</br>
<img src="vog.jpg" alt="VOG Introduction Image 2">
<h3>Rerun</h3>
<p>Should you wish to run the Vault of Glass again, it is advised that you take some of those Vault of Glass weapons and armour you earned with you. This is because the rewards you earn in the Raid contain intrinsic perks that are useful with dealing many of the Raid Encounters. Specifically in the Vault of Glass, all of the Raid's Weapons have the intrinsic perk, Oracle Disruptor. This is a perk that increases the damage of the weapons that have it against Oracles. Secondary weapons such as the Found Verdict and Praetorian Foil are fantastic for dealing with them because of this perk.
</br>
</br>
As for armour, the Vault of Glass armour doesn't necessarily carry too many benefits, save for the increased resistance against Void-based Attacks (Minotaurs, Templar, Gatekeepers and Atheon) and increased Super Energy gained when killing Praetorians and Oracles.
</p>
</br>

</br>
<img src="vog3.jpg" alt="VOG Introduction Image 2">
<h3>Good Hunting!</h3>
<p>Now that you've beaten the Vault of Glass, you're free to do whatever you want. You could run it again, run another Raid or even just brag to your friends how the Mythoclast dropped with an Adept Fatebringer Exotic and Ghost Shell.
</br>
</br>
It's your call!
